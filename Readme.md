### Andras' Library of Handy Utilities

This is a placeholder for some of the code I've been working on
that I want easy access to.  Feel free to browse and use!

## Contents

### getopt

traditional unix command option extractor, returns an object with
the options set as properties.

### tempnam

php tempnam equivalent, creates a filename that does not exist on the
system.  Like php, it also creates the file to prevent the name from
being reused.
